						<h1>What We Do</h1>
						<p>TMW offers a wide variety of customized options designed to help solar integrators grow. Especially in today's tough economic situation, unfortunately a climate where innovation is often pushed aside or simply taken off the agenda as some organizations struggle to stay afloat, successful companies need to stay focused on new ideas to succeed.</p> 
						<p>TMW is committed to growth and innovation. We specialize in working with small, rapidly growing solar integrators in upcoming markets elegantly handle scaling issues and in helping larger solar integrators whose growth has recently been stagnating deal with the rapidly changing market situations involved in the solar business today. When you work with TMW we first need to do a site visit of your offices to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your company. Before the site visit we perform extensive market and opposition research on your market area. After the visit we write up a proposal detailing bottlenecks/procedural errors we encountered and recommend fixes.</p>
